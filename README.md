# SD Lora Tagger

This extension allows searching extra netwroks by tag files that can be created and edited for all of your checkpoints and extra networks (not exclusive to just Loras).

### Features
 - __Search by Tags__:  Using the regular checkpoint/embedding/lora/etc. search bar, search for your extra networks using custom tags (the default tags are the extra network file names)
 - __Refresh Tags__:  Using the regular extra network refresh button, register new tags with the webui and search like normal without having to restart your server
 - __TODO__; Edit Tag Files Through the webui:

This extension is built to work with the major distributions of the `AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui` including the popular `vladmandic/automatic` fork.
 - If the extension is bugged on your specific fork of the `AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui`, please create an issue and I will try to address it as soon as possible
